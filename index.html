              The average cost of an adult funeral in the United States has been on the rise for decades. According to data collected by the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA), the average American family
              spent $9,135 dollars on a funeral in 2019, a nearly $2000 difference from the average cost in 2015. This increase in cost isn’t just due to inflation. In fact, the average funeral in 1960 cost $708—at the current rate of inflation, that
              would cost $6,333 in 2020 dollars. Experts in the field see this trend of increasing prices as a result of the corporatization of the funeral industry. Sarah Chavez, the executive director of the Order of the good Death, an advocacy
              group and organization of industry professionals, thinks many funeral directors rely on misleading consumers into purchasing more expensive services.“Of course they’re going to choose what is most profitable to them,” Chavez told CNET.
